Encryption

An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme. First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text. Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints: [√L] <= row <= column <= [√L] where [x] is floor function and [x] is ceil function Example s = if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots After removing spaces, the string is 54 characters long. is between 7 and 8, so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns. ifmanwas meanttos tayonthe dwouldha vegivenu sroots The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters of each column, with a space between column texts. The encoded message for the grid above is:

Create a function to encode a message.

Function Description

Complete the encryption function in the editor below.

encryption has the following parameter(s):

string s: a string to encrypt Returns

string: the encrypted string Input Format

One line of text, the string S

Constraints 1 <= length of s <= 81

s contains characters in the range ascii[a-z] and space, ascii(32).
